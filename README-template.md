## My process



### What I learned

-using flexbox for centering

```css
.body {
  display: flex;
  justify-content: center; 
  align-items: center; 
  height: 100vh; 
  margin: 0; 
  flex-direction: column;
}
```

-using Google Fonts

```css
@import url('https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Outfit:wght@100..900&display=swap');
```
